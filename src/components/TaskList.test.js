/* 

  Note that weâ€™ve been able to reuse the WithPinnedTasks 
  story in our unit test; in this way we can continue to leverage an existing resource 
  (the examples that represent interesting configurations of a component) in many ways. 
  
  Notice as well that this test is quite brittle. It's possible that as the project matures, 
  and the exact implementation of the Task changes --perhaps using a different classname or a 
  textarea rather than an input--the test will fail, and need to be updated. This is not necessarily 
  a problem, but rather an indication to be careful about liberally using unit tests for UI.
  They're not easy to maintain.
